description: This is my first and hopefully not last blog post. I have already started blogging several times, and it usually ended with a few posts. I have more blogging start-ups than blog posts. I hope this case will be an exception, and I will keep records for a long time.

Why do I need to blog? Why did I do it again?

## Improve and document my learning

I've learned a lot over the last 20 years (although I need to look at the CV for the exact date, I'm probably old). And how much of the experience is documented? Nothing. Sometimes you have to go back to old projects or tasks in the current project, and you completely forget how everything works there. Every time you have to do research again, which takes a considerable amount of time. Why not just document it and refer to it as a reference when needed? Documented experience will help to better retain knowledge in memory. And it can also be helpful to those who also explore a similar topic. After all, you spent quite a significant amount of time on it, which is not properly covered.
